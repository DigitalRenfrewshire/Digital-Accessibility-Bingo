- We have been meaning to do it for ages!
- Our users don’t need it.
- We would love to but we don’t have time.
- We can’t spare anyone to deal with this.
- There is no budget for this.
- It will destroy the nice design of our website/ animation/ film.
- We’ll do that with the next website/ animation/ film.
- People with disabilities aren’t in our target demographic.
- There is no one here that knows about this sort of stuff.
- We’re stuck with our website and we can’t change it.
- We have lots of other things to sort in our business/organisation first.
- That’s just political correctness!
- Someone’s making a fortune out of this accessibility thing.
- We can make it accessible at the end.
- We have deadlines to meet.
- We’ve got it covered. Our website has a button that allows you to change the font size.
- I’m sure our web developer looks after that.
- Its too late to add accessibility.
- It looks big enough/OK on my screen.
- It would make us fail accessibility standards.
- We can't do everything, and if we only do a bit we will get sued, so we are better off doing nothing.
- People don’t look at websites on their phones.
- No one really uses the website. Every things on social media now & that’s accessible.
- That's not our video, we just use it on our website ... that's why it isn't subtitled.
- We did put "accessibility" into our procurement requirements but our suppliers obviously didn't follow them. 
- Next month!
